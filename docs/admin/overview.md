# Introduction

::: danger Alpha Release
Version 1.x is currently in alpha release. We recommend this version for new projects, however, it is not
feature-complete and therefore may not be deemed production-ready.
:::

Lunar's admin panel is powered by Filament v3. It allows you to easily extend the admin panel to suit your project.

With the panel you can administer your products, collections, orders, customers, discounts, settings and much more.

## Contributing
